            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Jaigarh Fort was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II in 1726 to protect the Amber Fort and its palace complex. The fort was named after him. The fort served as a center of artillery production for the Rajputs and was a major cannon foundry.</p>
            
            <p>The fort remained intact over the centuries due to its strong structure and the fact that it was never conquered in battle. It was a well-guarded secret that the fort housed a massive treasure, believed to be the wealth of the Kachwaha rulers, which was reportedly found by the government of India during the Emergency in 1975.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>Jaigarh Fort is built with thick walls of red sandstone and is spread over 3 kilometers in length and 1 kilometer in width. The fort houses the world's largest cannon on wheels, called Jaivana, which was manufactured in the fort precincts in 1720.</p>
            
            <p>The fort complex includes a palace, a granary, a well-planned cannon foundry, several temples, and a tall tower. The fort's water supply system is considered an architectural marvel, with a unique rainwater harvesting system and a massive tank that can store 6 million gallons of water.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The main attraction of Jaigarh Fort is the Jaivana Cannon, which is the world's largest cannon on wheels. The cannon was fired only once, and its test shot is said to have created a small lake. The fort also houses a museum that displays artifacts, photographs, and information about the fort's history.</p>
            
            <p>The fort offers a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape, including the Amber Fort and the city of Jaipur. The armory, the puppet theater, and the extensive water harvesting system are other attractions that draw visitors to the fort.</p>
