                    <h2>Jal Mahal</h2>
                    <p>A palace located in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake in Jaipur, known as the "Water Palace."</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Jal Mahal, or the "Water Palace," was built in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber. The palace was constructed as a hunting lodge for the royal family. The building was renovated in the 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Amber to create a pleasure spot.</p>
            
            <p>The lake in which the palace is situated was created by constructing a dam between the hills to address the water shortage problem in the region. Over time, the palace became partially submerged due to the rising water levels of the lake.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>Jal Mahal is a five-story building, with four floors submerged when the lake is full. Only the top floor remains above the water level. The palace is made of red sandstone and features traditional Rajput and Mughal architectural styles.</p>
            
            <p>The rectangular chhatris (dome-shaped pavilions) on the corners and a large Bengali-style chatri in the center of the roof are distinctive features of the palace. The terrace garden, once used by the royal family for recreation, offers a panoramic view of the surrounding hills and lake.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The main attraction of Jal Mahal is its picturesque setting in the middle of Man Sagar Lake, with the Nahargarh hills forming a backdrop. The palace appears to float on the lake, creating a magical sight, especially during sunset.</p>
            
            <p>While the interior of the palace is not open to the public, visitors can enjoy the view from the banks of the lake. The area around the lake has been developed with promenades and viewing points, making it a popular spot for photography and relaxation.</p>
