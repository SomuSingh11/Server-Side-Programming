            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Albert Hall Museum was designed by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob and was opened to the public in 1887. It was named after King Edward VII (Albert Edward), who visited Jaipur as the Prince of Wales in 1876. The foundation stone of the museum was laid during his visit.</p>
            
            <p>The museum was initially built as a concert hall but was later converted into a museum to display the art and crafts of Rajasthan. It is the oldest museum in the state and functions as the State Museum of Rajasthan.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The Albert Hall Museum is a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, a blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles with Gothic touches. The building is adorned with murals depicting ancient civilizations and stone carvings.</p>
            
            <p>The museum is set in the middle of Ram Niwas Garden, which was built by Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II in 1868 as a famine relief project. The garden complex includes a zoo, a bird park, a greenhouse, a herbarium, and an art gallery.</p>
            
            <h3>Collections</h3>
            <p>The museum houses a rich collection of artifacts, including paintings, jewelry, carpets, ivory, stone, metal sculptures, and works in crystal. The collection includes coins from different periods of Indian history, decorative art, folk art, weapons, miniature paintings, and more.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most notable exhibits is an Egyptian mummy, which was gifted to the museum by the Brugsch Bey of the Museum of Cairo. The museum also has a vast collection of traditional Rajasthani costumes, textiles, and musical instruments.</p>
