            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Amber Fort was built by Raja Man Singh I in 1592 and expanded by successive rulers. The fort was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. The fort is built with red sandstone and marble and is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard.</p>
            
            <p>The fort was named after the small town of Amber and the Ambikeshwar Temple. The fort is known for its artistic style, blending both Hindu and Rajput elements. With its large ramparts, series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks the Maota Lake.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The fort consists of the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), and the Sukh Niwas. The Sheesh Mahal is a hall glittering with mirrors, where a single candle can light up the entire room.</p>
            
            <p>The fort's architecture is a remarkable blend of Hindu and Mughal styles. The fort complex is built with red sandstone and marble and is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. The main entrance to the fort is through the Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) which leads to the first courtyard.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>One of the most notable features of Amber Fort is the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), which is adorned with thousands of mirror tiles that create a dazzling effect when lit by candles. The fort also houses the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), and the Sukh Niwas (Hall of Pleasure).</p>
            
            <p>Visitors can also enjoy an elephant ride up to the fort, which adds to the royal experience. The sound and light show in the evening is another attraction that narrates the history of the fort and the Kachwaha dynasty.</p>
