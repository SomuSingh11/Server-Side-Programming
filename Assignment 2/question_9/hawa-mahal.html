                    <h2>Hawa Mahal</h2>
                    <p>Known as the "Palace of Winds," Hawa Mahal is one of the most distinctive landmarks of Jaipur.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Hawa Mahal was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who founded Jaipur. The structure was designed by Lal Chand Ustad in the form of the crown of Krishna, the Hindu god.</p>
            
            <p>The palace was built as an extension of the Royal City Palace and was used by the royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah" (face cover).</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The five-story palace is constructed of red and pink sandstone, highlighted with white quick lime. The palace is a blend of Hindu Rajput architecture and the Islamic Mughal architecture; the fluted pillars, floral patterns, and domed canopies are hallmarks of Rajput style, while the arches and stone inlay filigree work are of Islamic style.</p>
            
            <p>The unique five-story exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows called jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intention of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The main attraction of Hawa Mahal is its unique architecture and the panoramic view of Jaipur city that it offers. The small windows allow breeze to blow through the palace, giving it its name, the "Palace of Winds."</p>
            
            <p>Inside the palace, there is a small museum with miniature paintings and some rich relics, such as ceremonial armor, which help evoke the royal past. The palace also offers a beautiful view of the city from its top floors.</p>
