            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Galtaji Temple was built in the 18th century by Diwan Rao Kriparam, a courtier of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. The temple is dedicated to the sun god, Surya, and is named after Saint Galav, who is believed to have spent his life meditating at this place.</p>
            
            <p>According to legend, Saint Galav performed penance for 100 years, and the gods were pleased with him. As a blessing, they created a natural spring in this arid region. The temple complex was built around these natural springs.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The Galtaji Temple complex is built in pink sandstone and consists of several temples, pavilions, and natural springs. The complex is set in a narrow valley surrounded by hills, creating a picturesque setting. The architecture is a blend of Hindu temple architecture and Rajput style.</p>
            
            <p>The main temple has a cupola and painted ceilings, and it houses images of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Lord Hanuman, and other Hindu deities. The complex also includes several kunds (water tanks) where pilgrims take a holy dip.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The main attraction of Galtaji Temple is the natural springs and the seven holy kunds (water tanks), the most important being the Galta Kund, which never dries up. The temple is also known as the Monkey Temple due to the large number of monkeys that inhabit the area.</p>
            
            <p>The temple complex offers a panoramic view of the city of Jaipur. The Sun Temple, located at the top of the hill, is another attraction. The temple complex is a popular pilgrimage site, especially during the Makar Sankranti festival.</p>
