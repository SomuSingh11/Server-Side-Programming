            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The City Palace was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber in 1727. The palace was the seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur, the head of the Kachwaha Rajput clan. The palace complex has been gradually developed into a museum by the royal family.</p>
            
            <p>The palace was built between 1729 and 1732, initially by Sawai Jai Singh II. Later additions were made by successive rulers. The palace complex, which is located northeast of the center of the grid-patterned Jaipur city, incorporates an impressive and vast array of courtyards, gardens, and buildings.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The City Palace is a unique complex of several palaces, pavilions, gardens, and temples. The prominent structures are the Chandra Mahal, Mubarak Mahal, Mukut Mahal, Maharani's Palace, Shri Govind Dev Temple, and the City Palace Museum.</p>
            
            <p>The architecture of the palace is a fusion of Rajput, Mughal, and European styles. The palace complex is laid out in a grid pattern with wide avenues. The palace is a seven-storied building and each floor has a different name and was used for different purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The Chandra Mahal is the most commanding building in the City Palace complex. It is a seven-storied building and each floor has a different name and was used for different purposes. Only the ground floor is open to the public, and it houses a museum.</p>
            
            <p>The Mubarak Mahal, or the Welcome Palace, was built with a fusion of Islamic, Rajput, and European architectural styles. It now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, which displays royal costumes and other items from the royal heritage.</p>
