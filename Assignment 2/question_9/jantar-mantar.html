                    <h2>Jantar Mantar</h2>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Jantar Mantar was built by Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, between 1728 and 1734. He constructed a total of five such facilities at different locations, including the ones at Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, Mathura, and Varanasi. The Jaipur observatory is the largest and best preserved of these.</p>
            
            <p>Jai Singh had a keen interest in mathematics, architecture, and astronomy. After completing his successful studies, he built five astronomical observatories in west-central India. The name "Jantar Mantar" is derived from the Sanskrit words "yantra" (instruments) and "mantra" (formulae).</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>The Jantar Mantar consists of 19 astronomical instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars' locations, and determining celestial altitudes. The monument features masonry, stone, and brass instruments that were built using astronomy and instrument design principles from ancient Hindu Sanskrit texts.</p>
            
            <p>The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The monument expresses architectural innovations as well as the coming together of ideas from different religious and social beliefs in the 18th century.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The primary attraction at Jantar Mantar is the Samrat Yantra, a giant sundial that can tell the time to an accuracy of 2 seconds. Other instruments include the Jai Prakash, which can map the position of celestial bodies, and the Rama Yantra, which measures the altitude and azimuth of celestial objects.</p>
            
            <p>The observatory is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and represents the living heritage of astronomy. It continues to attract astronomers, historians, and tourists from around the world.</p>
