            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Nahargarh Fort was built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. The fort was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it later became known as Nahargarh, which means "abode of tigers." According to legends, the fort was haunted by the spirit of a Rathore prince, Nahar Singh Bhomia, and the name was changed to appease his spirit.</p>
            
            <p>The fort was primarily used as a retreat for the royal family and also served as a defense structure. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the fort provided refuge to many Europeans, including the British Resident's wife.</p>
            
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>Nahargarh Fort was built in the Indo-European architectural style. The fort complex consists of a palace known as Madhavendra Bhawan, which was built by Sawai Madho Singh. The palace has 12 identical suites for the queens, and all the suites are connected through corridors.</p>
            
            <p>The fort walls extend over the surrounding hills, forming a defensive ring around the city. The fort also features a temple dedicated to the deity of Jaipur rulers and several other structures, including a water harvesting system.</p>
            
            <h3>Attractions</h3>
            <p>The main attraction of Nahargarh Fort is the stunning view it offers of Jaipur city. The fort is especially popular at sunset when the city lights begin to twinkle below. The Madhavendra Bhawan, with its intricate frescoes and unique layout, is another highlight.</p>
            
            <p>The fort now houses a wax museum, a sculpture park, and a restaurant called "Padao," which is a perfect place to enjoy the view while dining. The fort has also been featured in several Bollywood films, including the popular movie "Rang De Basanti."</p>
